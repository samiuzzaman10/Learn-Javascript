/* JS Variables Rules:

1. A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location.

2. Name must start a letter(a to z or A to Z), underscore(_), or dollar($)sign.

3. After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.

4. Javascript variables are case sansitive, for example x and X are different variables.

var x = 10;
var y = 20;
var z = x + y;
document.write(z);
